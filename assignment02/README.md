TO RUN : make voronoi (to make binary) then simply run binary.

-worldgen

so with this assignment i have written a world generation c file that builds 
the world based on voronoi points, makes some pretty cool generations. i 
currenlty have the forest biome being mixed with a little bit of clearing,
but will change if needed.

-path gen

path genning is fine, no bugs should appear, wrote it based on what shaeffer 
recommended in class.

-building spawing (known bugs here)

building spawning was actually kind of difficult in that you constantly need
to check where building are spawning, i have most of the bound fixed for 
this but sometimes the buildings will still spawn ontop paths, or on the 
border. (will be fixed eventually, probably when i look at how shaeffer does 
it in his code)
